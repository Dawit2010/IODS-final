## Abstract

## Research Question

- linear regression of the GNI variable
- LDA of the new categorical variable HDIgroup

## Data wrangling
The human dataset has been prepared by merging datasets obtained from the human development reports website (http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/HDI). The human development index and gender inequality index were combined (done by Tuomo Nieminen as described on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TuomoNieminen/Helsinki-Open-Data-Science/master/datasets/human_meta.txt).Two variables describing female to male secondary education and labor force participation ratios have been added to the data as described in the course. In addition, a new categorical variable, named HDIgroup, assigning countries a categorical human development status based on their HDI has been added (Read page 3 for more information: http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2016_technical_notes.pdf).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Read human data to make new changes from Rstudio exercise 5
human <- read.table("data/human.txt",header=T, sep="\t")
str(human)

#summary(human)

library(GGally)

#ggpairs(human)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#summary(human)

library(GGally)

#ggpairs(human)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
