Human development and gross national income.

Human capital is an important aspect of a country's productivity. How much do human development factors relate to national income? how much do they predict per-capita income? In this repository, an analysis of this is performed using datasets from UNDP's human development reports (http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi). 


Please visit this github page for detailed description of the analysis performed. https://dawit2010.github.io/IODS-final/
